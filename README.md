karol-sytwu blog

Description 

This blog application is a two-page dynamic website where users will input and view their blog posts, and a toggle light/dark mode button is implemented. The user's inputs
were pushed to local storage, and rendered to the second page which was a feature of the Document Object Model's for web documents. The DOM, a programming interface, represents
the document as nodes and objects that allow it to be interacted with and modified by JavaScript. The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language but is instead a Web API used 
to build websites. 

Installation

N/A

Usage 

This dynamic application can be widely used for any application that requires interaction between the users and the business, and the data can be viewed and stored.
